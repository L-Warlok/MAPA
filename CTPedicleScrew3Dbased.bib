abstract="Although pedicle screw fixation is a well-established technique for the lumbar spine, screw placement in the thoracic spine is more challenging because of the smaller pedicle size and more complex 3D anatomy. The intraoperative use of image guidance devices may allow surgeons a safer, more accurate method for placing thoracic pedicle screws while limiting radiation exposure. This generic 3D imaging technique is a new generation intraoperative CT imaging system designed without compromise to address the needs of a modern OR.",
