abstract="Although pedicle screw fixation is a well-established technique for
	the lumbar spine, screw placement in the thoracic spine is more
	challenging because of the smaller pedicle size and more complex
	3D anatomy. The intraoperative use of image guidance devices

abstract="Transpedicular screw fixation has been accepted worldwide since
	Harrington et al. first placed pedicle screws through the isthmus.
	In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that pedicle screw insertion
	accuracy could be significantly improved with image-assisted systems
	compared with conventional approaches. The O-arm is a new generation
	intraoperative imaging system designed without compromise to address
	the needs of a modern OR like no other system currently available.
	The aim of our study was to check the accuracy of O-arm based and
	S7-navigated pedicle screw implants in comparison to free-hand
	technique described by Roy-Camille at the lumbar and sacral spine
	using CT scans. The material of this study was divided into two groups,
	free-hand group (group I) (30 patients; 152 screws) and O-arm group (37
	patients; 187 screws). The patients were operated upon from January to
	September 2009. Screw implantation was performed during PLIF or TLIF
	mainly for spondylolisthesis, osteochondritis and post-laminectomy
	syndrome. The accuracy rate in our work was 94.1{\%} in the free-hand
	group compared to 99{\%} in the O-arm navigated group. Thus it was
	concluded that free-hand technique will only be safe and accurate when
	it is in the hands of an experienced surgeon and the accuracy of screw
	placement with O-arm can reach 100{\%}.",

abstract="We performed a randomised controlled study to assess the accuracy of
	computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion versus conventional screw
	placement under clinical conditions. One hundred patients scheduled
	for posterior thoracolumbar or lumbosacral pedicle screw
	instrumentation were randomised into two groups, either for
	conventional pedicle screw placement or computer-assisted screw 
	application using an optoelectronic navigation system. From the
	computer-assisted group, nine patients were excluded: one because of
	an inadequate preoperative computed tomography study, seven because of
	problems with the specific instruments or the computer system,
	and one because of an intraoperative anesthesiological complication.
	Thus, there were 50 patients in the conventional group and 41
	in the computer-assisted group, and the number of screws inserted was
	277 and 219, respectively. There was no statistical difference between
	the groups concerning age, gender, diagnosis, type of operation
	performed, mean operating time, blood loss, or number of screws
	inserted. The time taken for screw insertion was significantly longer
	in the computer-assisted group. Postoperatively, screw positions were
	assessed by an independent radiologist using a sophisticated
	CT imaging protocol. The pedicle perforation rate was 13.4{\%} in the
	conventional group and 4.6{\%} in the computer-assisted group
	(P = 0.006). Pedicle perforations of more than 4 mm were found in
	1.4{\%} (4/277) of the screw insertions in the conventional group,
	and none in the computer-assisted group. Complications not related
	to pedicle screws were two L5 nerve root lesions, one end plate
	fracture, one major intraoperative bleeding and one postoperative
	death in the conventional group, and one deep infection in the
	computer-assisted group. In conclusion, pedicular screws were inserted
	more accurately with image-guided computer navigation than with
	conventional methods.",

title="Accuracy of free-hand placement of thoracic pedicle screws in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: how much of a difference does surgeon experience make?",

abstract="The use of thoracic pedicle screws for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has gained widespread popularity. However, the placement of pedicle screws in the deformed spine poses unique challenges, and surgeons experience a learning curve. The in vivo accuracy as determined by computed tomography (CT) of placement of thoracic pedicle screws in the deformed spine as a function of surgeon experience is unknown. We undertook a retrospective review to determine the effect of surgeon experience on the accuracy of thoracic pedicle screw placement in AIS. In 2005, we started to obtain routine postoperative CT scans on patients undergoing a spinal fusion. From a database of these patients, we selected AIS patients, who underwent a posterior spinal fusion. Fifteen consecutive patients for each of the following three groups stratified by attending surgeon experience were selected (N = 45): A) less than 20 cases of all pedicle screw constructs for AIS (surgeons <2 years of practice), B) 20--50 cases (surgeons 2--5 years of practice), and C) greater than 50 cases (surgeons greater than 5 years of practice). Intraoperative evaluation of all screws included probing of the pedicle screw tract, neurophysiologic monitoring, and fluoroscopic confirmation. A total of 856 thoracic pedicle screws were studied. Postoperative CT scans were evaluated by two spine surgeons and a consensus read established as follows: (1) In: intraosseous placement or ≤2-mm breach, (2) Out: >2-mm breach, either medial or lateral. Of the 856 screws, 104 demonstrated a >2-mm breach, for an overall rate of 12.1{\%} (medial = 55, lateral = 49, P = 0.67). When the breach rates were stratified by surgeon experience, there was a trend toward decreased rate of breach for the most experienced surgeons, although this did not attain statistical significance (Group A: 12.7{\%}, Group B: 12.9{\%}, Group C: 10.8{\%}, P = 0.58). However, the most experienced group (C) had a markedly decreased rate of medial breaches (3.5 vs. 7.4{\%} and 8.4{\%} for groups A and B, respectively, P < 0.01). The breach rate for the concave periapical screws was not statistically different from the overall breach rate (13.0{\%} vs. 12.1{\%}, P = 0.93). In conclusion, the overall accuracy of placement of pedicle screws in the deformed spine was 87.9{\%}, with no neurologic, vascular, or visceral complications. Meticulous technique allows spine surgeons with a range of surgical experience to accurately and safely place thoracic pedicle screws in the deformed spine. The most experienced surgeons demonstrated the lowest rate of medial breaches.",
