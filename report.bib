abstract="Although pedicle screw fixation is a well-established technique for
	the lumbar spine, screw placement in the thoracic spine is more
	challenging because of the smaller pedicle size and more complex
	3D anatomy. The intraoperative use of image guidance devices 
	may allow surgeons a safer, more accurate method for placing thoracic
	pedicle screws while limiting radiation exposure. This generic 3D
	imaging technique is a new generation intraoperative CT imaging system
	designed without compromise to address the needs of a modern OR.",

title="Computer tomography assessment of pedicle screw placement in lumbar and

abstract="Transpedicular screw fixation has been accepted worldwide since
	Harrington et al. first placed pedicle screws through the isthmus.
	In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that pedicle screw insertion
	accuracy could be significantly improved with image-assisted systems
	compared with conventional approaches. The O-arm is a new generation
	intraoperative imaging system designed without compromise to address
	the needs of a modern OR like no other system currently available.
	The aim of our study was to check the accuracy of O-arm based and
	S7-navigated pedicle screw implants in comparison to free-hand
	technique described by Roy-Camille at the lumbar and sacral spine
	using CT scans. The material of this study was divided into two groups,
	free-hand group (group I) (30 patients; 152 screws) and O-arm group (37
	patients; 187 screws). The patients were operated upon from January to
	September 2009. Screw implantation was performed during PLIF or TLIF
	mainly for spondylolisthesis, osteochondritis and post-laminectomy
	syndrome. The accuracy rate in our work was 94.1{\%} in the free-hand
	group compared to 99{\%} in the O-arm navigated group. Thus it was
	concluded that free-hand technique will only be safe and accurate when
	it is in the hands of an experienced surgeon and the accuracy of screw
	placement with O-arm can reach 100{\%}.",

title="Accuracy of pedicle screw insertion  with and without computer

	patients",

volume="9",
number="3",
pages="235--240",
abstract="We performed a randomised controlled study to assess the accuracy of
	computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion versus conventional screw
	placement under clinical conditions. One hundred patients scheduled
	for posterior thoracolumbar or lumbosacral pedicle screw
	instrumentation were randomised into two groups, either for
	conventional pedicle screw placement or computer-assisted screw 
	application using an optoelectronic navigation system. From the
	computer-assisted group, nine patients were excluded: one because of
	an inadequate preoperative computed tomography study, seven because of
	problems with the specific instruments or the computer system,
	and one because of an intraoperative anesthesiological complication.
	Thus, there were 50 patients in the conventional group and 41
	in the computer-assisted group, and the number of screws inserted was
	277 and 219, respectively. There was no statistical difference between
	the groups concerning age, gender, diagnosis, type of operation
	performed, mean operating time, blood loss, or number of screws
	inserted. The time taken for screw insertion was significantly longer
	in the computer-assisted group. Postoperatively, screw positions were
	assessed by an independent radiologist using a sophisticated
	CT imaging protocol. The pedicle perforation rate was 13.4{\%} in the
	conventional group and 4.6{\%} in the computer-assisted group
	(P = 0.006). Pedicle perforations of more than 4 mm were found in
	1.4{\%} (4/277) of the screw insertions in the conventional group,
	and none in the computer-assisted group. Complications not related
	to pedicle screws were two L5 nerve root lesions, one end plate
	fracture, one major intraoperative bleeding and one postoperative
	death in the conventional group, and one deep infection in the
	computer-assisted group. In conclusion, pedicular screws were inserted
	more accurately with image-guided computer navigation than with
	conventional methods.",
